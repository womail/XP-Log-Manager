# XP-Log-Manager

XP-Log-Manager is a tool designed to help users manage and analyze logs generated by the X-Plane flight simulator. This application provides a user-friendly interface for viewing, filtering, and exporting log data, making it easier for users to troubleshoot and optimize their X-Plane experience.

I created this tool to help with debugging X-Plane issues. The follow feature can be really useful to watch real time issues.
You can monitor multiple logs at the same time.
Create a zip to send to the developers.
